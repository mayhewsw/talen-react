# TALEN React Frontend

## Initial Details

Much of the frontend was taken from [https://github.com/cornflourblue/react-redux-registration-login-example](https://github.com/cornflourblue/react-redux-registration-login-example), with many thanks. I converted it into Typescript and Redux, but it started there. I mainly took that part for the sake of help with authorization, and JWT.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
